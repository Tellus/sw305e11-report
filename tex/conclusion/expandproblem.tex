\section{Expanding the problem domain}
\todo{"What can this program also be used for e.g.normal kindergarten"}
During this project we have based the product upon the needs of a kindergarten that has children with autism, however, this product could be used by kindergarten and schools for children with different disabilities.

evt. Adults with disabilities?

The Giraf system and Administration administration could be used for children without any disability, where the contact book then could be used between parent and kindergarten or school teacher. 

For schools: an application could be develops such that the child's homework where entered every day, and solutions(just to the parent) such that the parent are able to help the child with his/hers homework.(meant for children up to 10-11 years)
