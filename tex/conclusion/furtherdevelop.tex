\subsection{myAccount and News}
\label{myAccount}
%Maybe it should say somthing like: MyAccount and the News homepage was designed but not complitily implented - René rettet:lisbeth
MyAccount and the News homepage was designed but not completely implemented. The model for both my account and News is done, but both controller and view is missing.

As in our design the myAccount would contain personal information and the user would be able connect a child to him/herself and connect the child with an device. Furthermore all the user's connected children would be able to be made into groups by the user.

In news a parent should be able to receive general news from the Kindergarten, while the kindergarten teachers also can add news.  

\subsection{Application administration}
We did not get to making an application administration system to aSchedule or DigiPECS. These administrations system would need the android synchronization such that the mobile devices' will be updated. 

The aSchedule administration would be like a normal calendar that also uses PECS to illustrate the child's schedule for a day. 

DigiPECS administration would be a program where the user could use to make and edit PECS, and it should then have access to an public archive of PECS (evt. opensource where the user also can add PECS) and a private archive for private pictures and PECS. 

\subsubsection*{Personalize}
This section should describe the "Settings" application, in which the user can edit information about the child and add/remove eventual handicaps. (It should also not be called "Settings" as it is an insensitive name.


\subsection{Site Admin}
Administering applications, groups and children are only the outermost pieces of the full scope of site administration. Tools for super users such as user administration and managing global application access (e.g. auditing and authorising new controllers for recently-added Giraf-compliant applications) should be staples.

\subsection{Delevoper guide}
During development of the first architecture it became evident that expanding the system was quite difficult, even with comprehensive code documentation. Writing a developer guide that describes philosophies, conventions and inspirations would be the next step in opening up the system to new functionality.

\subsection{Remote installation}
At one point it was considered that applications could be installed remotely, that is without a user installing from the device, instead marking applications for installation through the web site and the device performing the install on its next synchronisation.
