guardians = parents

In our project we have had contacted with Birken which is a kindergarten for special-needs children that is located at Vodskov in Northern Denmark region. Our contact from Birken Kristine Niss-Henriksen have been included in this project because of her knowledge about children with autism and technological knowledge who then would be able to help come up with ideas and opinions about our program and finally test the final program.
