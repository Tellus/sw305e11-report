\chapter{Modeling the product}
After analysing the problem and the solution provided by previous \emph{GIRAF} project groups, we can begin design of the product.
This modeling chapter contains a class diagrams of the GIRAF-W-11 framework, that would have to be designed and implemented before a fully functional contact book could be implemented. Furthermore, a function list of what the GIRAF-W-11 initially should be able to do.
