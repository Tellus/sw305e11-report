\todo{I future work kommer det i de tre første paragraffer til at handle lidt for meget om hvad I ikke nåede i stedet for hvad man eller kan lave. Dette er nok bare mest et spørgsmål om at ændre nogle af formuleringerne så det ikke bliver så meget: "Det nåede vi heller ikke ..." -ulrik}

\section{User Applications}

My Account and the News homepage was designed but not completely implemented. The model for both My Account and News is done, but both controller and view is missing and thus has no actual functionality.

\subsection{My Account}
My Account is designed to manage the settings of the user. When accessed a pop-up box would appear, containing three tabs, Personal Information, Tablets and Groups. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Personal Information should contain data of the user, such as name and contact information.
\item Tablets should provide options for the user to add and remove tablets from the user's account. This is necessary as a parent or guardian can own more than one tablet.
\item Groups allows the user to manage the group he or she is a member of. It is furthermore possible to create and invite members to group if the user had the necessary user rights.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{News}
News is a page available on the front page for the user to easily get updated on relevant news. The section could contain updates from the contact book, new applications available or new calendar entries.   

\subsection{Special Applications}
While designing the prototype, we agreed on giving some specific applications a special role in the application list. They are not actual applications, installed on the tablet and managed through the computer, but typically has a more general role. The two primary applications is the Personalize and GIRAF Marked, which is described in the next sections. 

\subsubsection*{Personalize}
The Personalize application, also called Settings, allows the user to edit the information of the child, i.e. name, age, contact information and so forth. Furthermore the user can specify the child's eventual disabilities for the tablet.

\subsubsection*{GIRAF Marked}
The GIRAFMarked is a market place for developers to publish applications designet for autistic children and the GIRAF system. Through this application it is possible to download more applications for the tablet. 







\section{GIRAF Application administration}
\input{tex/conclusion/GIRAF_Application_Administrators.tex}


\section{Site Administration}
Administering applications, groups and children are only the outermost pieces of the full scope of site administration. Tools for super users such as user administration and managing global application access (e.g. auditing and authorising new controllers for recently-added Giraf-compliant applications) should be staples.

\section{Developer guide}
During development of the first architecture it became evident that expanding the system was quite difficult, even with comprehensive code documentation. Writing a developer guide that describes philosophies, conventions and inspirations would be the next step in opening up the system to new functionality.

\section{Remote installation}
The current GIRAF client already contains functionality to fetch and install applications from the GIRAF Place application server, this functionality is planned to be extended with an update feature, where the synchronization service pulls the server for updates making it into an automated process. This could be extended to include remote installation of applications on the device which Android currently features. Inspiration on how such feature could be implemented using the Android service class is accessible \cite{DevRemote}.
