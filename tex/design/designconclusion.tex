\chapter{Conclusion}

By making diagrams, following patterns and splitting the system into different parts, designing the system has been trivial.
When designing it was crucial that the group kept redesigning and improving the prototype, got feedback from outside and visualised more than just the interface which the user interacts with.
Redesigning the prototypes helped the group to better understand the mistakes made on previous ones.
The feedback from the group's contact helped make final decisions and bring focus on to more important parts of the system.
While the interface is extremely important when designing, the also important components that make the system functional were not forgotten.
After visualising, prototyping and designing the architecture of the system, implementation of the final product began.
