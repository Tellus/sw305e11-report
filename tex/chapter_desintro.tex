\chapter{Designing the product}
After analyzing the problem and the solution provided by previous \textit{GIRAF} groups, we can begin design of the product.
This includes interviewing someone within the problem area, where much needed feedback and opinions can help form our final product.
The design phase consists of prototype creation, class and control-flow diagrams, visual designing and feedback from our contact.
