 

GIRAF Application Administrators refers to the earlier Figure \vref{fig:classOversigt}, and these applications were not made in this project, but it were taken into account, that it should be implemented. The GIRAF applications DigiPECS and aSChedule would each need an administrator application so the user would be able to administer the application on the mobile device. However, for this to work the synchronization service has to be completed as was discussed in both chapter \vref{androidDesign} and subsection \ref{androidReflection}.
   
\subsection{DigiPECS administrator}
%DigiPECS administration would be a program where the user could use to make and edit PECS, and it should then have access to an public archive of PECS (evt. opensource where the user also can add PECS) and a private archive for private pictures and PECS.


\subsection{aSchedule administrator}
%The aSchedule administration would be like a normal calendar that also uses PECS to illustrate the child's schedule for a day.
