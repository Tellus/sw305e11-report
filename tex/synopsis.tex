This project is based on an Android system made in a bachelor multiproject in 2011. The developed system was called GIRAF. The initializing problem from the original project proposal, was to make a PC tool, used for administration of the applications developed for the GIRAF system. During the project the group has been cooperating with Birken, which is a institution for autistic children. After the first meeting with the representative Kristine Niss-Henriksen, the focus of the project was changed from making an administration tool, to making a digital version of a contact book; like the one used by Birken to communicate between the institution and the parents.

This report describes the development of GIRAF administration system with main focus on the contact book. The report includes the usage of models, prototypes, client-server architecture, and the implementation of the model-view-controller design. Furthermore to evaluate the system both unit testing and usability testing were used.
