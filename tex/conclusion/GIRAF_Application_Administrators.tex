%We did not get to making an application administration system to aSchedule or DigiPECS. These administrations system would need the android synchronization such that the mobile devices' will be updated. 

%The aSchedule administration would be like a normal calendar that also uses PECS to illustrate the child's schedule for a day. 

%DigiPECS administration would be a program where the user could use to make and edit PECS, and it should then have access to an public archive of PECS (evt. opensource where the user also can add PECS) and a private archive for private pictures and PECS.
