%The report delves into the world of assessments tests as seen from the perspective of the software developer. Through analysis of current social and economic concerns regarding the use of standardised tests in public and private institutions, the report defines a base specification for a generalised testing format applicable to test of arbitrary objectives. A reference implementation of the platform is designed, and while all lower-level layers have been implemented, only a base version of the applications used to create and participate in tests have been implemented. Besides the inherent issues in current testing applications found through analysis, the project deals with XML (and XML-derivatives such as the project's own file format and XHTML), serialization, XSLT and graph theory.
