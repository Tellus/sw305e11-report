\section{Current functionality}

The implementation finished during this project only supports user login/registration (not forgotten password support) and the modular controller API for new applications, in which Contactbook was a proof of concept. However, all front-end administration (of groups, children, devices and applications) was only completed on the concept level. Any of these changes must currently be performed directly on the database by an administrator.
