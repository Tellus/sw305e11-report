\section{Current functionality}

%The implementation finished during this project only supports user login/registration (not forgotten password support) and the modular controller API for new applications, in which Contactbook was a proof of concept. However, all front-end administration (of groups, children, devices and applications) was only completed on the concept level. Any of these changes must currently be performed directly on the database by an administrator.

%Der er ikke tilføjet noget som ikke stod der i forvejen, der er bare blevet skrevet om på det der stod i forvejen
At the end of the project the functionality of the implanted software supports login of an existing user and registration of a new user, although the system does not support forgotten passwords. Furthermore the system support the modular controller API for new applications, in which the contact book application was a proof of concept. 
The functionality of the contact book application makes it possible for both parents and kindergarten teachers to write and upload posts, which is possible for the other to see.  Furthermore it is possible for both the parents and the kindergarten teachers to edit, delete and reply posts, and it is possible to attach pictures to a post, and upload the picture together with the text, however it is not possible to edit the picture. Further the posts can only be uploaded using a computer and it is not possible to upload posts or pictures using a mobile device.

However, all front-end administration, which means administration of groups, children, devices, and application, was only completed on the concept level, which means, it was thought about, but it was not further developed. Any administrative changes of group, children, devices, and applications must be preformed directly on the database by an administrator.
