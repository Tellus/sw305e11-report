\section{Architecture}
The generic MVC architecture is pervasive throughout modern software, if not intentionally at least as an aggregate part of the design. In the domain of web development, the powerful segregation of layers combined with the flexibility of modern web servers allows for a high degree of modularity and security.
The same applies for the GIRAFAdmin architecture. The three layers have very distinct roles within the framework. Combined with the naming and file structure conventions, extending functionality through modules should be a simple matter of creating new classes with specific inheritance.
