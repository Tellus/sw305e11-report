\section{Usability testing process}

\subsection{Planning}
% write out testing times (the third meeting) and note what we wanted to test (which features?) and which attributes of those features we'd like to determine the usability of (for example, ease of use, if enough of the features are supported, etc). 

\subsection{Third meeting \& testing}
% already in process, this was very informel remember to note that.

\subsection{Evaluation}
% what did we learn from the meeting.
