\chapter{Introduction}

In our project we have had contact with Birken which is a kindergarten for special-needs children, which is located at Vodskov in Northern Denmark region.
Our contact from Birken, Kristine Niss-Henriksen has been included in this project because of her knowledge about children with autism and experience with today's technology.
With her help we were able to get a different view on things and new ideas for our program. We also got her to test our first functional prototype, which helped us form our final product.
