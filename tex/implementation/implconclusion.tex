\chapter{Summary}
%Hvad fik vi med i programmet. MVC struktur, working contact book 
%Opsummering på hvad vi har skrevet i delen Implementationen.

The final version at deadline contains an extendable framework, supporting both extension of the core system and adding functionality for new GIRAF applications by plugging in new MVC components.
The core system contains basic access control, database abstractions through the model layer and an MVC API that should simplify future development.
As a proof-of-concept in the implementation, a working contact book is implemented.

%Seriously guys, I have no clue what to add....
%I've read the implementation part 3 times now and still nothing....
