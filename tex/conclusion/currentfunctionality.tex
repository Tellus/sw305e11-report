%\todo{"vi er kun nået et minimum. vi har en kontaktbog og login, men vi kan ikke tilføje børn/device(MyAccount). En henvisning til futherdevelopment med hensyn til det der ikke er med. "}
The implementation finished during this project only supports user login/registration (not forgotten password support) and the modular controller API for new applications (in which Contactbook was a proof of concept). However, all front-end administration (of groups, children, devices and applications) was only completed on the concept level. Any of these changes must currently be performed directly on the database by an administrator. \textbf{- Johs}

The Giraf Administration application can at this point only create a new user, login and use the contact book. However, we did have the time to make my Account\ref{myAccount} such that the user also would be able to be connected with the children and their devices so they actually could use the contact book. Furthermore the user cannot connect apps to devices. 
%Currently the above has to be done in the database, by an administrator of the system.    -Lisbeth
