\chapter{Summary}
By making diagrams, following patterns and splitting the system into different parts, the design phase was more manageable.
When designing it was crucial that the group kept redesigning and improving the prototypes, got feedback from outside and visualised more than just the interface, which the user interacts with.

Redesigning the prototypes helped the group to better understand the mistakes made on previous ones.
The feedback from the interviews helped the group make final decisions and focus on important parts of the system.
While the interface is extremely important when designing, the also important components that make the system functional were not forgotten. 

The Android application framework was not completed, although it was designed in detail. 

After visualising, prototyping and designing the architecture of the system, implementation of the final product began.
