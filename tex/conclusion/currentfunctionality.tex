\section{Current functionality}

%The implementation finished during this project only supports user login/registration (not forgotten password support) and the modular controller API for new applications, in which Contactbook was a proof of concept. However, all front-end administration (of groups, children, devices and applications) was only completed on the concept level. Any of these changes must currently be performed directly on the database by an administrator.

The current implemented system supports login of an existing user and registration of a new user, although the system does not support forgotten passwords. Furthermore the system support the modular controller API for new applications, in which the contact book application was a proof of concept. 
The functionality of the contact book application makes it possible for both parents and kindergarten teachers to write and upload posts. Furthermore it is possible for both the parents and the kindergarten teachers to edit, delete, attach pictures and reply to a post, however it is not possible to edit the picture. This can be done through the web implemented system since an application to the device was not designed. 

All front-end administration, e.g administration of groups, children, devices, and application, was completed on the concept level, but not further developed. Any administrative changes of group, children, devices, and applications must be performed directly in the database by an administrator.
