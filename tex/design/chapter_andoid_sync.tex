\chapter{Android-Server synchronization}
\label{androidDesign}
This chapter deals with the design of the Android Application framework, which provides information on how to implement a protocol, a client and server for synchronization of GIRAF applications, user profile and settings.
The protocol section describes communication stages, such as performing the handshake. Client design includes signal message handling received from the server; the server design includes command messages that can be sent to the server as well. 
The section also contains thoughts and ideas on how the framework could be extended to provide additional functionality.
