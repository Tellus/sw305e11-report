\chapter{Tools and Languages}

During development, four languages were utilised: the markup language \emph{HTML} along with the stylesheet language \emph{CSS}, and the scripting languages \emph{PHP} and \emph{JavaScript}. These were chosen because they are some of the most common web-designing tools and have widespread documentation. HTML, JavaScript and CSS are currently supported on all major browsers, including but not limited to \emph{Google Chrome}, \emph{Mozilla Firefox} and \emph{Internet Explorer}. Likewise, PHP is supported by major web servers (\emph{Apache} and \emph{Lighttpd}) and operating systems (\emph{Windows} and \emph{Unix}.
Together these languages are quite powerfull for designing websites because of their difference in functionality.
