\chapter{Tools \& Languages}
<<<<<<< HEAD

To develop the client, four languages were used, the markup language \textit{HTML} along with the style sheet language \textit{CSS}, \textit{PHP} and \textit{JavaScript}, both scripting languages. These were chosen because they are some of the most common web-designing tools and have easy-access documentation. Both \textit{HTML} and \textit{JavaScript} are currently supported by the most common browsers, including but not limited to \textit{Google Chrome}, \textit{Mozilla Firefox} and \textit{Internet Explorer}.
Together these languages are quite powerfull for designing websites because of their difference in functionality.
